# Sudoku-Solver
A Sudoku solver for any grid size.

The grid sizes ```sizeX``` and ```sizeY``` refer to the smaller rectangle and not the total grid size.
This is because the small cells don't need to be squares and its size defines the size of the total grid.

The main goal was to design the solving algorithm.
For simplicity, a GUI was not implemented. 

The problem grid can be inputed in the Main class.
